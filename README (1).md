# ðŸŽ¥ Movie Search Engine

This project is a React-based movie search engine that uses the RapidAPI IMDb API to fetch detailed movie information, including IMDb ratings, genre, and more. Users can search for movies by title and view their details in a clean, responsive interface. The app is built using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look and feel.
